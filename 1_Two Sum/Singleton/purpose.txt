use case: When we need only one instance of an object
----------

why need only one instance? 

1. file writting: definitly we shold stop file writting at same time with more than one thread.file writting should be syncronous.
(ex: writting error in log file  )

implementation step
---
1. Make Private Constractor
2. Make Public Static Method
3. Make a Public Static field (static because we need only one instance so we have to hold the instance)
